This is a prototype to explore Earthstar

## Run locally

If you have python installed, you can run it locally by using the following command:

> If Python version returned above is 3.X
> On Windows, try "python -m http.server" or "py -3 -m http.server"
`python3 -m http.server`
> If Python version returned above is 2.X
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

If you run into difficulties, check out this [web page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server) for instructions on how to set-up a local testing server.
