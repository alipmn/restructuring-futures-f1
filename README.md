# ReStructuring Futures (RSF) 

A public notebook for [Restructuring Futures](https://www.ukai.ca/counterfoil/restructuring-futures), an experimental collaboration between the [Laboratory for Artistic Intelligence](https://artisticintelligence.com/) and [Ukai Projects](https://www.ukai.ca/) supported by a grant from the [2020-2021 Digital Strategies Fund](https://canadacouncil.ca/funding/strategic-funds/digital-strategy-fund) at Canada Council for the Arts. 

From the grant:
> To research and prototype tools, processes, and systems to envision and operate a virtual artist-run centre within alternative digital economies and emergent cooperative frameworks. We will convene a think tank to look at new platforms by alternative technologists which have been built on a different set of values than tools like Zoom/Facebook/Instagram. Based on the think tank discussions, Ukai and the Lab will work with partners to iterate some proposed solutions. Ad hoc, imperfect, but working solutions are the goal -- much like the way artists ‘hack’ together vibrant, alternative art spaces and communities in overlooked spaces offline.

## Curious? Want to know more?

We're still in the phase where we are more quiet about this work, thought Ukai and Lai are leading though residencies that engage with community members. You can email [project.rsfutures@hypha.coop](mailto:project.rsfutures@hypha.coop) to get ahold of all of us at Hypha!
