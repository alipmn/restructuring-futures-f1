To run the Dockerfile provided, you first need to ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. Once you've done that, you can follow the steps below to build and run your Docker image.

    Open Terminal: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you've saved your Dockerfile.

    Build the Docker Image: Now that your terminal's working directory is where your Dockerfile is located, you can use the following command to build your Docker image:

 `docker build -t deno-server . `

In this command, -t deno-server gives your image a tag or a name ("deno-server") for easier reference, and the . indicates that Docker should look for the Dockerfile in the current directory.

    Check your Image: To ensure your image was created successfully, you can list out your Docker images with the command:



 `docker images `

You should see your deno-server image in the list.

    Run your Docker Container: Now you can run your Docker container from your newly created image:

 `docker run -p 8000:8000 -p 443:443 deno-server `

This command tells Docker to run a new container from the deno-server image. The -p flags bind the ports inside the Docker container to ports on your machine, so you can access your Deno server.
